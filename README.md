Hello! Welcome to my Final Project for my Computing II class at IUPUI.
The requirements for this project were to create a Java program that:
  * demonstrates all concepts of Object-Oriented Programming 
  * has proper implementation of Abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes)
  * shows use of data structures (linked lists, stacks, arraylists)

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
